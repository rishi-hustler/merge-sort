# Merge Sort (Java)

## 📌 Overview

**Merge Sort** is a **divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm** that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

It guarantees **O(n log n)** time complexity in all cases.

## 🚀 Algorithm Used

**Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)**

### Steps:

1. Divide the array into two halves
2. Recursively sort each half
3. Merge the sorted halves

## 🧮 Time and Space Complexity

* **Best Case:** `O(n log n)`
* **Average Case:** `O(n log n)`
* **Worst Case:** `O(n log n)`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
